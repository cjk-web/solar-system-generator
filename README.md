# Procedurally Generated 3d Star Systems 

I've been wanting to try out three.js, and this is project I've been thinking about for a while. Currently very early in development, working on some of the basics to set up the 3d scene and make it look decent for now. Also building out a rough draft of base classes needed to set up procedural generation that will eventually be the foundation for all the stellar objects that may appear in a procedural system.
